# The Lit Template

Create fast Node.Js applications!

## Background

Sometimes we just want to create fast Node.Js applications to solve basic problems. I found it very tedious to create my projects from scratch every single time. I also do not like the express-generator project setup; and thats how TheLitTemplate took place ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting started

1. Start by cloning this repo: `git clone https://github.com/camilo86/TheLitTemplate`

2. Navigate inside the template folder (for example `cd TheLitTemplate`)

3. Start the server `npm start`
